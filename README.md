genome-grist analyzes the strain composition of microbial metagenomes
using
[minimum metagenome covers](https://dib-lab.github.io/2020-paper-sourmash-gather/)
and produces a variety of compositional and taxonomic summaries.

Check out the
[quick start!](https://dib-lab.github.io/genome-grist/quickstart/) And
please see
[the full documentation](https://dib-lab.github.io/genome-grist/) for
more information after that.

## Example: the strain composition of a gut microbiome (iHMP)
